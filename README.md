### The Platybox Service

We are releasing the Platybox service developed by Box 60 Inc. as a way to reach
back to our community. Feel free to use this code, providing you notice that
it was originally developed by Box60.

### What platybox is/was.

Platybox was a service that allowed people to connect with places on a more intimate
level. We saw platybox as the future of geolocation, where people could connect with
the places they loved and viceversa. We explored a more tight integration of mobile
devices with point of sales systems and social media. As a result a place could
give you a better experience.

Platybox was used to power http://www.chowvancouver.com/ and was discontinued in 2013.

### Status

We stopped development of Platybox in 2013. Our market research pointed to adoption
barriers that platybox couldn't overcome with present mobile technologies. We conducted
several Alpha deployments and tested our technologies thoroughly before taking the painful
decision of discontinuing the service.
